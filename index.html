          Ruth Bader Ginsburg became the second female justice of the U.S.
          Supreme Court. Born in 1933 in Brooklyn, New York, Bader taught at
          Rutgers University Law School and then at Columbia University, where
          she became its first female tenured professor. She served as the
          director of the Women’s Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties
          Union during the 1970s, and was appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals
          for the District of Columbia in 1980.
        </p>
        <p>
          Named to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1993 by President Bill Clinton, she
          continued to argue for gender equality in such cases as United States
          v. Virginia. She died September 18, 2020 due to complications from
          metastatic pancreas cancer.
        </p>

        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
          Ruth Joan Bader, the second daughter of Nathan and Cecelia Bader grew
          up in a low-income, working class neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York.
          Ginsburg's family was Jewish. Ginsburg’s mother, a major influence in
          her life, taught her the value of independence and a good education.
          Cecelia herself did not attend college, but instead worked in a
          garment factory to help pay for her brother’s college education, an
          act of selflessness that forever impressed Ginsburg.
        </p>
        <p>
          At James Madison High School in Brooklyn, Ginsburg worked diligently
          and excelled in her studies. Her mother struggled with cancer
          throughout Ginsburg’s high school years, and died the day before
          Ginsburg’s graduation. Bader graduated from Cornell University in
          1954, finishing first in her class.
        </p>
        She married Martin D. Ginsburg, also a law student, that same year. The
        early years of their marriage were challenging, as their first child,
        Jane, was born shortly after Martin was drafted into the military in
        1954. He served for two years and, after his discharge, the couple
        returned to Harvard where Ginsburg also enrolled.
        <p>
          At Harvard, Ginsburg learned to balance life as a mother and her new
          role as a law student. She also encountered a very male-dominated,
          hostile environment, with only eight females in her class of 500. The
          women were chided by the law school’s dean for taking the places of
          qualified males. But Ginsburg pressed on and excelled academically,
          eventually becoming a member of the prestigious legal journal, the
          Harvard Law Review.
        </p>

        <h2>Arguing for Gender Equality</h2>
        <p>
          Then, another challenge: Martin contracted testicular cancer in 1956,
          requiring intensive treatment and rehabilitation. Ginsburg attended to
          her young daughter and convalescing husband, taking notes for him in
          classes while she continued her own law studies. Martin recovered,
          graduated from law school, and accepted a position at a New York law
          firm. Ginsburg transferred to Columbia Law School in New York City to
          join her husband, where she was elected to the school’s law review.
          She graduated first in her class in 1959.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite her outstanding academic record, however, Ginsburg continued
          to encounter gender discrimination while seeking employment after
          graduation. After clerking for U.S. District Judge Edmund L. Palmieri,
          she taught at Rutgers University Law School (1963-72) and at Columbia
          (1972-80), where she became the school’s first female tenured
          professor.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the 1970s, she also served as the director of the Women’s
          Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), for which
          she argued six landmark cases on gender equality before the U.S.
          Supreme Court. However, she also believed that the law was
          gender-blind and all groups were entitled to equal rights. One of the
          five cases she won before the Supreme Court involved a portion of the
          Social Security Act that favored women over men because it granted
          certain benefits to widows but not widowers.
        </p>

        <h2>On the Supreme Court</h2>
        <p>
          In 1980, President Jimmy Carter appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the
          U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. She served there
          until she was appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1993 by President
          Bill Clinton, selected to fill the seat vacated by Justice Byron
          White. President Clinton wanted a replacement with the intellect and
          political skills to deal with the more conservative members of the
          Court.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Senate Judiciary Committee hearings were unusually friendly,
          despite frustration expressed by some senators over Ginsburg’s evasive
          answers to hypothetical situations. Several expressed concern over how
          she could transition from social advocate to Supreme Court Justice. In
          the end, she was easily confirmed by the Senate, 96-3. Ginsburg became
          the court's second female justice as well as the first Jewish female
          justice.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a judge, Ginsburg was considered part of the Supreme Court’s
          moderate-liberal bloc, presenting a strong voice in favor of gender
          equality, the rights of workers and the separation of church and
          state. In 1996, Ginsburg wrote the Supreme Court’s landmark decision
          in United States v. Virginia, which held that the state-supported
          Virginia Military Institute could not refuse to admit women.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1999, she won the American Bar Association’s Thurgood Marshall
          Award for her contributions to gender equality and civil rights.
        </p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>
          Despite her reputation for restrained writing, she gathered
          considerable attention for her dissenting opinion in the case of Bush
          v. Gore, which effectively decided the 2000 presidential election
          between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Objecting to the court’s majority
          opinion favoring Bush, Ginsburg deliberately and subtly concluded her
          decision with the words, “I dissent” a significant departure from the
          tradition of including the adverb “respectfully.”
        </p>
        <p>
          On June 27, 2010, Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s husband, Martin, died of
          cancer. She described Martin as her biggest booster and “the only
          young man I dated who cared that I had a brain.” Married for 56 years,
          as a couple, they were said to be quite different: Martin was
          gregarious, loved to entertain and tell jokes while Ruth was serious,
          soft-spoken and shy. Martin provided a reason for their successful
          union: “My wife doesn’t give me any advice about cooking and I don’t
          give her any advice about the law.”
        </p>
        <p>
          After 27 years serving as a justice on the Supreme Court, Ruth Bader
          Ginsburg died on September 18, 2020 due to complications from
          metastatic pancreas cancer.
